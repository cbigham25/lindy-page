                    <p>M. J. Lindemann is the author of an upcoming epic fantasy trilogy. He lives with his husband and two dogs in Minnesota. In addition to writing, he works as a public health nurse, helping to connect people to home services.</p>

                    <p>  When he's not spending every moment of his free time writing, he plays video games, watches an unholy amount of T.V., plays D&D, and reads (of course). His favorite genres are science fiction and fantasy, but he'll dive into anything that's a good story.</p>

                    <p>   What you'll find in his writing: Found family. Rich worlds. Diverse casts of characters. Heartwarming moments. Tragedy and hope.</p>

                    <p>  What you won't find: Sexual assault of any kind. Racism. Sexism. Homophobia or transphobia.</p>
